# üåç Muzi Ka Nkulunkulu Management System (MKN-MS)

The **Muzi Ka Nkulunkulu Management System (MKN-MS)** is a modern, web-based platform built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**. It serves as the official management tool for the Muzi Ka Nkulunkulu religion, providing digital oversight of members, duties, attendance, and growth analytics across branches and regions.

The system begins with a single-branch MVP but is designed to scale globally as the community grows.
